#### Statistical Measures

* Mean

* Median

  Median of a dataset is the **middle** observation of a dataset.

  The number of observations can be either of the following:

  * **Odd** : The middle observation is the median.
  * **Even** : The average of the middle observations is the median.
* Mode

  Mode is the most **frequent** observation in a dataset.
* Standard Deviation

* Variance

  The Variance (σ^2) of observations can be calculated by using the following formula:

* Standard Deviation and Variance

  Standard Devation = √Variance
* Experiment

  An 'Experiment' is a procedure that can be repeated  **infinitely** , resulting in a set of possible outcomes.
* Sample Space

  The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment forms a 'Sample Space'.
* An **'Event'** is a subset of the outcomes of an experiment. Event ⊆ SampleSpace

* Probability, i) The likelihood of the occurrence of an event is known as probability.  ii)The value of probability of an event lies between **0** and  **1** .

Probability (P)= No.of FavorableOutcomes / Total no.of outcomes = n(E) / n(S)

###### Types of Events

**
    Simple Event**

    Any event containing a**single** element of a sample space.

**
    Compound Event**

    Any event containing**two or more** elements of a sample space.

**
    Dependent Event**

    If the occurrence of an event is**influenced** by another event, it is called a 'Dependent Event'.

**
    Independent Event**

    If the occurrence of an event is**not influenced** by another event, it is called an 'Independent Event'.

**
    Exhaustive Events**

    A set of events devouring the**entire sample space** .

**
    Mutually Exclusive**

    Two events are said to be mutually exclusive events when both cannot occur at the same time.

*
    Example:*

    While driving a car, the steering wheel cannot be turned left and right at the same time. Therefore, the 		events turning left and turning right are considered to be mutually exclusive.
